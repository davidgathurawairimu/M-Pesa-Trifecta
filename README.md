# M-Pesa-Trifecta
A lightweight Python utility designed to extract the core "trifecta" of M-Pesa transaction data: Amount, Date, and Recipient/Sender Name. Clean, fast, and regex-powered.

M-Pesa-Trifecta is a specialized parser that cuts through the noise of M-Pesa confirmation messages. Instead of dealing with messy strings, this tool isolates the three most critical data points for financial tracking:

Amount: Precision numerical extraction (Float).

Date: Cleaned and standardized timestamps.

Name: Accurate identification of the person or business involved.

Perfect for personal finance trackers, automated bookkeeping, or small business ledger integration.
